You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml\nname: Your name here! # Shows in the footer\nenableToc: true # Whether to show a Table of Contents\nenableLinkPreview: true # whether to render card previews for links\ndescription: Page description to show to search engines\npage_title: Quartz Example Page # Default Page Title\n\nlinks: # Links to show in footer\n  - link_name: Twitter\n    link: https://twitter.com/_jzhao\n  - link_name: Github\n    link: https://github.com/jackyzha0\n```\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml\nenableLegend: false # automatically generate a legend\nenableDrag: true # allow dragging nodes in the graph\nenableZoom: true # allow zooming and panning the graph\ndepth: -1 # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\npaths: # colour specific nodes path off of their path\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### Do I need a website already?\nNo! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

This seems fairly obvious to me in my own reading but there are commentaries that think of it as three people, so I've used separate highlighting for the Shepherd and the King and I'll review later why I think they are the same person.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-03-29T14:49:42.158651734Z","tags":null},"/Ô∏è-My-Public-Garden/Song-of-Solomon-A-Review-by-Chuck-Missler":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\n\n\n# Song of Solomon\n\n\nA review of a message by [[Chuck Missler]]\nFor the original see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY4Elgw1Mds\nThe Song of Solomon review starts at 36:45\n\n\nTheme: Ultimate love\nNo other book of Scripture has given rise to more commentaries and opinion\nThe Key is Psalm 45, A song of Loves\n- A royal marriage hymn\n- The Heavenly Bridegroom\n\n\n\n | various views    |                                                                                                                                                        |\n |","lastmodified":"2022-03-29T14:49:42.158651734Z","tags":null},"/Ô∏è-My-Public-Garden/Song-of-Solomon-A-review-by-David-Pawson":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"# Song of Solomon\n\nA review of [[Song of Solomon]], a message by [[David Pawson]]\nFor the original see:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHOdzOSpDk\n\n\n\nThis book is one of three writings by Solomon.

Part one can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyIz4oj_U6A\u0026t=200s\n\n## An Achievement to Celebrate\nThe Easter Story is an achievement.   The whole of the OT has been leading up to this point from the fall in Gen 3.\n\n\nSeparation by the Church from the Biblical text.  \n\n## Quatrodecimans controversy\n\n```ad-WellEstablished\ntitle:Quatrodecimans controversy\ncollapse: closed\n\nQuatrodecimans = fourteenism  refers to the original Christians that insisted upon fixing the celebration of [[Passover]] on the fourteenth day of [[Nisan]] in the Old Testament Calendar.  [[Lev 23#5]]\n\nExodus 12:14:\n![[Exo 12#14]]\n\n```\n\n```ad-WellEstablished\ntitle: Early Tensions\ncollapse: closed\n\n![[Chuck Missler - The Easter Story Slide 1.png]]\n\n```\n\n```ad-WellEstablished\ntitle: Council of Nicea - Quatrodecimans Excommunicated\ncollapse: closed\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 2.png]]\n\n```\n\n```ad-WellEstablished\ntitle: Antisemitism in the early Church\ncollapse: closed\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 3.png]]\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 4.png]]\n\n```\n\n\n[[Antisemitesim]] was rife in the early Church.   And not surprisingly so, the Jews were seen as being responsible (at least in part) for the death of Jesus.   The early church view was **\"they've had their chance, now its our turn!\"**\n\nThe Christian chuch was operating under the Julian calendar based on solar years.  The Jews has always opperated on lunar years.\n\n```ad-WellEstablished\ntitle: Calendar contensions\ncollapse: closed\n\n\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 5.png]]\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 6.png]]\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 7.png]]\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 8.png]]\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 9.png]]\n\n\n\n\n```\n\nAll of this to avoid [[Passover | Easter]] from falling over [[Pasover]]. \n\n## Friday or Wednesday\n\n3 strong reasons why most scholars believe Good Friday is very likely Good Wednesday.\n\n\n**Matt 12:40**\n![[Matt 12#40]]\n\n3 days and 3 nights. There is not enought time between Good 'Friday' and Sunday to have 3 days and 3 nights in between.   Wednesday fits perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n**John 12:1**\n![[John 12#1]]\n\n6 days before Friday would be a sabbath.   The journey between Jerich and Bethany was 20 miles which is father than considered appropriate for a Sabbath.\n\n\n**Matt 28:1**\n![[Matt 28#1]]\n\n\u003eSabbath can mean Sunday but also one of seven high Sabbath' (or festivals) throught the year.   In other words there were two Sabbaths between Passover and Sunday Morning.\n\n\n![[Chuck Misler - The Easter Story Slide 11.png]]\n\n\n```ad-Vision\ntitle: Dave's Thoughts\n\n\nAs I read this I'm reminded how in our modern western mindset we've forgotten / lost / or not even been aware of, the connection between Easter and passover.  \n\nPassover is the celebration of the Isrilites rescue from captivity in Egypt.  Which is a foreshadow of the work that Jesus did on the cross.\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Who is calling the shots\n\n**Jesus.**  \n\nRead the account of [[Matt 26#The Last Supper 17-30 | The Last Supper]] Judas was preparing for the betrayal but it wasn't the timing he was after.   The Jews would never have wanted to interrupt the Passover celebrations but Jesus forced his hand.  \n\nLets look a little closer:\n\n**Matt 26:4**\n![[Matt 26#4]]\n\nThe word treachery (see [[G1388]]) could have been translated subtly or in private.  They wanted to keep Jesus death quite.   [[Chuck Missler]] stated that Satan's plan would have been to kill Jesus by [[stoning]] but Jesus' plan was to fulfill the prophecy of death by a cross.   A prophecy that was made some 600 years before the method of crucifixion was invented.\n\n\n\n**Matt 26:5**\n![[Matt 26#5]]\n\nThis was a Roman province, the Romans would by and large leave the Jews to their own affairs as long as they kept order.   A riot would necessitate Roman intervention that no body wanted.\n\n\n## Jesus' Final Week\n\n |                      | **Mathew** | **Mark** | **Luke** | **John** |\n |","lastmodified":"2022-03-29T14:49:42.158651734Z","tags":null}}
