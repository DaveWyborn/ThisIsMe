# Song of Solomon

A review of [[Song of Solomon]], a message by [[David Pawson]]
For the original see:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZHOdzOSpDk



This book is one of three writings by Solomon.  You can tell Solomons age by the style of writing, this book was written as a young man full of love for a woman with little thought about God.



A love story.

Many teachers claim this is a story of 3 Characters, a shepherd, a girl and a king.
Its often preached upon to illustrate the struggle of men and women as they fight to choose between God and the Devil (the king of the world)


Its really a story of two people, the king who presents himself as a shepherd.
