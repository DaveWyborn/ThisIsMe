# Song of Solomon
Read: [[Song of Solomon]]



As part of my daily devotional I routinely ask the Lord what book of the bible I should be reading.   Time, and time again I'm amazed at how significant each book is to my personal walk, but its not always so obvious what the Lord is trying to show me.   Sometimes I read a book from the bible and its obvious what the Lord is saying, other times I have to read and study the book to full understand.   This book is one of those moments.

I've already reviewed messages by [[Song of Solomon - A Review by Chuck Missler|Chuck Missler]] and [[Song of Solomon - A review by David Pawson|David Pawson]], but after reading them I felt there was more for me to learn.  

### Highlighting in the Bible

I don't like highlighting in my bible, digital or otherwise.   My OCD gets the better of me here and I like to keep it nice and tidy.   But this book is one exception that needs a little guidance.   The conversation is back and forth between two people and its easy to get lost in it.  So I've used the following highlights to point out the different characters:

<mark class="hltr-cyan">Shepherd</mark> 
<mark class="hltr-pink">Girl</mark> 
<mark class="hltr-blue">King</mark> 

As we'll see a little later the Shepherd and the King are one and the same person.  This seems fairly obvious to me in my own reading but there are commentaries that think of it as three people, so I've used separate highlighting for the Shepherd and the King and I'll review later why I think they are the same person.
