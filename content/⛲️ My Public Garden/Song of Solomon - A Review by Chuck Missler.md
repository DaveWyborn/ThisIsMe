Some Jewish Rabbi's view this as the most holy book of the bible.  See [Rabbi Akiva](https://what-when-how.com/love-in-world-religions/akiva-ben-yosef/).

Of those that supported including the Song of Solomon in the bible did so because they saw the story of Love as fundamental to our faith, as love is the greatest symbol of our connection with God.

Jewish Rabbis were prohibited from reading the book until they were 30 years old.


The Song of Solomon was part of the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible)
Therefore it was part of scripture when Jesus was alive.  In [[john 10#35]] Jesus states the scripture can not be broken.   Meaning, it does not need to be broken.  It was complete.   If the scripture was complete then the Song of Songs is complete.





## Who is Solomon?

Solomon 700 wives, 300 concubines.   They turned away his hear:

![[1 Kings 11#1]]![[1 Kings 11#2]]![[1 Kings 11#3]]![[1 Kings 11#4]]

King of Israel
Son to David.
Solomon was not David's first born but he was David's preferred choice.    David himself was not the first born and made Solomon King before he died to ensure his older sons didn't try to take the throne.
Song of Songs was one of over 1000 songs written by Solomon




Song of Solomon is an Opera:

	- Shulamit is the Cinderella 
- Handsome stranger promises to return
	- Family skeptical during the extended absence

	- Adonijah tried to take her as his wife
	- Solomon had him executed [[1 Kings 2]]
